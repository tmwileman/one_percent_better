# NEW FOCUS
I need to reengage the basics of my profession. To do this, I'm going to work my way through some text books foundational to being a data scientist. First is Statistics (9th Edition) by Robert S. Witte and John S. Witte. 

# Chapter 2: Describing Data with Tables and Graphs
## Frequency Distributions for Quantitative Data
- A **frequency distribution** is a collection of observations sorted into classes and showing the frequency of occurrence in each class. When the observations are sorted into classes of single values, the result is a **frequency distribution for ungrouped data**. When the data is grouped  into classes that encompass more than one value, the result is called a **frequency distribution for grouped data**. This is recommended when there are more than 20 possible values.
## Guidelines
- Below are seven rules for frequency distributions
	- Each observation should be included in one, and only one, class.
	- All classes, even those with zero observations, should be listed.
	- All classes should have equal intervals.
	- All classes should have both a lower and upper boundary.
	- Select class intervals from convenient numbers like 1, 5, and 10.
	- The lower boundary should be a multiple of the interval (i.e. if interval is 10 lower boundaries could be 10, 20, etc.).
	- Try to keep the total number of classes to <=10.
## Outliers
- An outlier is an extreme score. Whenever you encounter one, attempt to verify its accuracy. They may be excluded from some summaries but can also provide insight into special circumstances that help you better understand your data. 
## Relative Frequency Distributions
- **Relative frequency distributions** show the frequency of each class as a part or fraction of the total. To construct a relative frequency distribution simply divide the frequency of each class by the total number of observations.
## Cumulative Frequency Distributions
- **Cumulative frequency distributions** show the total number of observations in each call and in all lower-ranked classes. To create one simple sum the frequencies of all classes at and below each class. 
## Graphs for Quantitative Data
- A **histogram** is a bar-type graph for quantitative data. A bars of a histogram consist of a series of bars whose heights reflect the frequencies for the various classes. A **frequency polygon** or **line graph** can be constructed by placing dots at a consistent point in each bar and then connecting those points with a line.
## Typical Shapes
- **Positively skewed** distributions include a few extreme observations in the positive (right) direction. **Negatively skewed** distributions include a few extreme observations in the negative (left) direction. 
## Graph for Qualitative (Nominal) Data
- A **bar graph** is a bar-type graph for qualitative data. Gaps between adjacent bars emphasize the discontinuous nature of the data.
