# NEW FOCUS
I need to reengage the basics of my profession. To do this, I'm going to work my way through some text books foundational to being a data scientist. First is Statistics (9th Edition) by Robert S. Witte and John S. Witte. 

# Chapter 8.1-8.6: Populations and Samples

## Populations
- A **population** is the entire set of individuals or objects of interest or the measurements obtained from all individuals or objects of interest.
- **Real populations** could be the set of all students enrolled in a particular university during a particular semester or the ages of all visitors to Disneyland on a particular day.
- **Hypothetical populations** occur when all potential observations are not accessible at the time of sampling. An example is the set of all possible measurements of the height of a particular tree. You can't measure the heights of all trees, but you can measure the heights of a sample of trees and then use that sample to make inferences about the population of all trees.

## Samples
- A **sample** is a subset of the population.
- There is no simple rule for determining the size of a sample. The size of the sample depends on the purpose of the study, the nature of the population, and the resources available for the study. Inferences based on small samples are typically less reliable than inferences based on large samples.

## Random Sampling
- **Random sampling** is a sampling procedure in which each member of the population has an equal probability of being selected for the sample.
- Casual or hap-hazard sampling is not random sampling as it does not give each member of the population an equal chance of being selected for the sample.

## Random Assignment
- **Random assignment** is a procedure in which each member of a sample has an equal chance of being assigned to each of the groups in an experiment.
- Random assignment can be accomplished any number of ways. For example, you could assign each member of the sample a number and then use a random number generator to assign each member to a group.
- Equal numbers of subjects should be assigned to each group in an experiment. This is called **equalization**.
