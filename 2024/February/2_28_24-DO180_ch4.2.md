# Red Hat OpenShift Administration 4.2 Deploy Managed and Networked Applications on Kubernetes
#Tags: #RedHat #RHCA #Kubernetes #DO180

# Purpose
- Deploy a database from an image and template using the cli. Then compare the resources and attributes

# Login
```
oc login -u <username> -p <password> <path to os instance>
```

# Create a project named deploy-newapp
```
oc new-project deploy-newapp
```

# Observe resources
```
oc get all
```

# See the services and secrets in the project
```
oc get serviceaccounts

oc get secrets
```

# Create two MySQL instances with different options
```
oc describe template mysql-persistent -n openshift

oc new-app -l team=red --template mysql-persistent -p MYSQL_USER=developer -p MYSQL_PASSWORD=developer

oc new-app --name db-image -l team=blue --image <image path> -e <key>=<value>
```

# List all pods that contain "team" as a label
```
oc get pods -L team
```

# Compare the resources in each pod
```
oc get pods -l deploymentconfig=mysql -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec/containers[0].readinessProbe}' | jq
```

# See that the image-based-pod does not contain a readiness probe
```
oc get pods -l deployment=db-image -o json-ath='{.items[0].spec.containers[0].readinessProbe}' | jq
```

# Also see that the image-based-pod has no resource limits
```
oc get pods -l deployment=db-image -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.containers[0].resources}' | jq
```

# Retrieve secrets in the project
```
oc get secrets
```

# See how not supplying a label shows all services
```
oc get services
```

# Next, see how supplying a label shows only the labeled services
```
oc get services -l team=red
```

# See that not all resources include the label, like pods created with the template
```
oc get pods -l team=red
```

# Delete resources that use the team=red label
```
oc delete all -l team=red

oc delete secret,pvc -l team=red
```
