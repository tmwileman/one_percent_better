# Resources and Resource Definitions
- Resources are configuration files for components you want runnning in your cluster. They can represent various types of resources including pods, applications, and databases. These resources are typically in YAML format. 

- Resources can be deleted using labels or by deleting entire projects.
```
oc delete deployment -l app=my-app
```

# Templates
- A template is exactly what it sounds like. A YAML file that can be configured in the CLI to create any number of resources. To see the parameters of a template that can be defined use the following command:
```
oc process -f mysql-template.yaml --parameters
```

- You can create new applications using templates:
```
oc new-app --tempalte mysql-persistent
```

# Pod
- A pod is the smallest compute unit that can be defined, deployed, and managed. It runs one or more containers that represent a single application. Containers in a pod share resources.
- Deployment configurations define pod configuration.

# Projects
- A project is a Kubernetes namespace. They're used to manage access to resources for users. They can be created from templates and use Rold Based Access Control (RBAC) for permission management. 

# Services
- A service object enables pod-to-pod network communication.

# Persistent Volume Claims
- Clusters have a persistent volume (PV). Developers make claims to volumes for their namespaces (projects) known and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs). Admins bind PVs to PVCs. 

# Secrets
- Provide a way to hold sensitive information like passwords.

# Imperative Resource Management
- Imperative commands are a fast way to create pods because they don not require a pod object definition but they can't be versioned. Imperative commands are generally used in testing.
```
oc run example-pod --image=<image> --env=<env=env>

oc create deployment my-app --image <image>
```

# Declarative Resource Management
- Declarative methods <em>declare</em> the intended state of the resoureces. This means that we're using config files to manage resources.
``` oc new-app --template mysql-persistent --param MYSQL_USER=<user>```
