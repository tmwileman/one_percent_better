# NEW FOCUS
I need to reengage the basics of my profession. To do this, I'm going to work my way through some text books foundational to being a data scientist. First is Statistics (9th Edition) by Robert S. Witte and John S. Witte. 

# Chapter 3: Describing Data w/ Averages
## Mode
- The **mode** is the more frequently occurring value. Distributions can have more than one mode. **Bimodal** distributions have two peaks (the peaks don't have to be exactly the same height). **Multimodal** distributions have more than two peaks. 
## Median
- The **median** reflects the middle value when observations are ordered from least to most. For example, if you have the following observations, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the median is 3. If the number of observations is odd than the median is the average of the two middle observations. For example, the median of the distribution, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, is 2.5.
## Mean
- The **mean** is found by adding all scores and then dividing by the number of scores. For example, the mean of the distribution 1, 2, 3, is 2 ((1+2+3)/3). You could think of the mean as the balance point for a frequency distribution. 
## Which Average?
- There are two types of means. A sample mean and a population mean. **Sample means** represent the mean of a sample and are denoted by the symbol x̄. **Population mean**s represent the mean of an entire population and are represented by the symbol μ. 
- If a distribution is skewed, a single measure of centrality doesn't tell the whole story. Importantly, the mean is sensitive to extreme values or outliers. As a result the median, mode, and mean can tell a better story about the entire distribution when combined. As a result, its best practice to report both the mean and median when the distribution is skewed. 
## Averages for Qualitative and Ranked Data
- The median can be used whenever it is possible to order qualitative data from least to most because the level of measurement is ordinal.
-  Means cannot be used with qualitative data.
