# Interview Question
What's the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning

# Interview Answer
These are two fundamental approaches to machine learning problems. The use of one or the other depends on the data available, the question being answered, and the preferred method of answering that question. 

Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data. This means that our training data includes the category or numerical value that we're trying to predict for each obseravtion that we have data on. The goal is to use these training data to create an algorithm that can make accurate predictions on new data that does not include the label. Examples of supervised learning problems include classification, such as spam detection in emails where emails are calssified as "spam" or "not spam", or regression, like when we try to predict the price a home will sell for based on previously sold homes.

Unsupervised learning is the opposite. In this case, our training data does not include a label. Instead, we're trying to decipher patterns or structures from the data without any explicit instructions. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering, like trying to identify what makes customer segments distinct from marketing data, and association, in which we try to identify rules like people that buy X also tend to buy Y.

The data on hand typically drives which approach is used. If a label is present you use supervised methods and try to predict a specific categoy or value. If a label isn't present you use unsupervised approaches and see what you can decipher from the data.
