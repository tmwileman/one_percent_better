# NEW FOCUS
I need to reengage the basics of my profession. To do this, I'm going to work my way through some text books foundational to being a data scientist. First is Statistics (9th Edition) by Robert S. Witte and John S. Witte. 

# Chapter 8.7-8.10: Probability

## Probability
- **Probability** is the proportion or fraction of times that a particular event is likely to occur.
- Probability can be determined in several ways. We can *speculate* about the probability of an event occurring, we can *observe* the frequency with which an event occurs. 
- Sometimes we'll use observation and speculation to determine the probability of an event occurring. For example, we might observe the distribution of the heights of a sample of trees and then speculate about the probability of a tree being a certain height.
- The **addition rule** is used to determine the probability of several mutually exclusive events occurring. The probability of the occurrence of any one of several mutually exclusive events is the sum of the probabilities of the individual events. For example, the probability of rolling a 1 or a 2 on a die is 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3.
- The **multiplication rule** is used to determine the probability of two or more independent events occurring. The probability of the occurrence of two or more independent events is the product of the probabilities of the individual events. For example, the probability of first rolling a 1 and then rolling a 2 on a die is 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36.
- **Independent events** are events in which the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other event. For example, the probability of rolling a 1 on a die is 1/6. If you roll a 1 on a die, the probability of rolling a 2 on the next roll is still 1/6.
- **Dependent events** are events in which the occurrence of one event affects the probability of the occurrence of the other event. For example, the probability of drawing a 1 from a deck of cards is 1/52. If you draw a 1 from a deck of cards, the probability of drawing a 2 on the next draw is 4/51.
- **Conditional probability** is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred. For example, the probability of drawing a 2 from a deck of cards given that you have already drawn a 1 is 4/51.

## Review Questions
- Television stations sometimes solicit feedback volunteered by viewers about a televised event. Following a televised debate between Obama and McCain in 2008, a TV station conducted a telephone poll to determine the "winner". Callers were given two phone numbers, one for Obama and one for McCain to register their votes.
    - Comment on whether or not this was a random sample.
        - This was not a random sample. The sample was self-selected. Only people who were motivated to call in were included in the sample.
    - How might this poll have been improved?
        - The poll could have been improved by using random sampling. For example, the TV station could have randomly selected phone numbers from a list of all phone numbers in the area. Or, the TV station could have used random sampling to select participants for a focus group. 
- As subjects arrive to participate in an experiment, tables of random numbers are used to make random assignments to either group A or group B. Indicate with a Yes or No whether each of the following rules would work:
    - Assign the subject to group A if the random number is even and to group B if the random number is odd.
        - Yes. This is a valid rule for random assignment.
    - Assign the subject to group A if the first digit of the random nubmer is between 0 and 4 and to group B if the first digit of the random number is between 5 and 9.
        - No. This is not a valid rule for random assignment. The first digit of a random number is not random.
