# NEW FOCUS
I need to reengage the basics of my profession. To do this, I'm going to work my way through some text books foundational to being a data scientist. First is Statistics (9th Edition) by Robert S. Witte and John S. Witte. 

# Chapter 6: Describing Relationships: Correlation

## An intuitive approach
- **Positive relationships** exist when pairs of scores occupy similar relative positions in their respective distributions (low values paired with low values, high values paired with high values). 
- **Negative relationships** exist when pairs of scores occupy dissimilar relative positions (high values with low values and vice versa).
- A **scatterplot** is a graph containing a cluster of dots representing all pairs of scores. Scatterplots can be used to graphically show correlation.
- The more closely dot clusters approach straight lines the stronger the relationship will be.
- A **linear relationship** can closely approximates a straight line.
- A **curvilinear relationship** resembles a curved line.
- A **correlation coefficient** is a number between -1 and 1 that describes the relationship between pairs of variables. 
- **Pearson correlation coefficients** can equal any value between -1.00 and 1.00. The sign indicates the type of linear relationship and the numerical value indicates the strength of the relationship.
- **Correlation coefficients** are calculated by summing the products of z<sub>x</sub> and z<sub>y</sub> for each observation and then dividing by n-1.
