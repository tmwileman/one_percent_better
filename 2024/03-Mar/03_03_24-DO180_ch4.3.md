# Red Hat OpenShift Administration 4.4 Manage Long-lived and Short-lived Applications by Using the Kubernetes Workload API
#Tags: #RedHat #RHCA #Kubernetes #DO180

# Workload Resources
- The Kubernetes Workloads API has resources that support various tasks. The most often used resources are Jobs, Deployments, and Stateful Sets

# Jobs
- A job is a one-time task. These include initializing a databse, calculating metrics, or restoring backup data. 
- Example of a job is:
```
oc create job \ # creates a job resource 
date-job \ # specifices job name
--image registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/bui \ # sets container image to use
-- /bin/bash -c "date" # specifies what to do in the container
```

# Cron Job
- Cron-jobs are jobs that run on a recurring basis. Frequency of rerun is done suing the Cron format. 

```
oc create cronjob date-cronjob \ # create cron-job resource and name it
--image registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi \ # Set image for container
--schedule "*/1 * * * *" \ # Specifies the schedule
-- date # Command executed in job
```

# Deployments
- Deployments create or delete replicas of a pod until the number of pods matches the number of replicas specified.

```
oc create deployment \ # create deployment resource
my-deployment \ # Names deployment
--image registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi \ #sets image for pods
--replicas 3 # Sets the deployment to maintain three instances of the pod
```

- Pods in deployments are exact copies of eachother and are created using the pod template.
- Labels can be used to provide metadata on deployments

# Stateful Sets
- Stateful sets are like deployments but pods are unique. This is helpful when pods must be slightly different like when pods need network identifiers or persistent storage.
