# One Percent Better Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the One Percent Better project, inspired by the principle of continuous improvement outlined in James Clear's book, <em>Atomic Habits</em>. This repository is a personal journey of professional and self-development, aiming to embody the philosophy that small, consistent improvements lead to significant growth over time.

## Project Overview

The core idea of this project is simple: each day, I will add a markdown file on a topic that interests me and is beneficial for professional development. This daily practice is based on James Clear's concept that improving by just 1% every day can lead to substantial growth and success.

## Repository Structure

- **Month Subdirectories:** Within each year, folders are dedicated to each month.
- **Daily Markdown Files:** For each day of the month, a markdown file captures insights, learnings, and reflections on various topics.
- **Reading List:** A curated list of resources and readings that have influenced this journey, available in the root directory.
