# Analogy
You and a group of friends decide to bake a cake together. Each of you brings different ingredents. One brings flour, another eggs, another sugar, and so forth. Everyone loves the cake but you start to wonder, "who contributed the most to making the cake so delicious?" It's not easy to say because each ingredient played a role. Shapley values are a way to figure out each ingredient's contribution to the success of the cake. The method works like this:

- **Consider all combinations** - You look at every possible combination of ingredients. For example, what if the cake had only been made of flour and eggs? Or sugar, eggs, and flour but not butter?
- **Measure the difference** - Measure how much worse or better the cake would have been without each ingredient. For example, without sugar, is the cake more or less delicous thant if it lacked flour. 
- **Average contribution** - After looking at all these combinations, calculate the acerage impact of each ingredient. This tells you, on average, how much each ingredient contributedto the deliciousness of the cake. 

Think of each ingredient as a feature in a model. Using the methodology discussed above, we can get a sense for how influential each feature is to the model's results.

# SHAP overview
SHAP is a method used to explain the output of machine learning models. It's part of a broader area known as explainable AI, whcih aims to make decisions of AI systems understandable to humans. 

# Why needed
ML models can be like black boxes. It's hard to understand why they make certain decisions. SHAP is a tool that helps open this black box by looking at how results differ if features are removed.

# Based on game theory
In game theory, SHAP values are a way to fairly distribute the payoff in a game to the players based on their contribution. 

# How SHAP works
SHAP calculates the contribution of each feature to the prediction made by the model. It does this by systematically removing each feature from a dataset, records the results, and looks at the differences. A removed feature that causes results to be more different than the removal of other featues is considered more important.

# Advantages
SHAP has the following advantages:
- **Individual prediction explanation** - SHAP explains individual predictions. This is really useful when it's important to understand specific decisions like why a loan application was denied. 
- **Consistency and accuracy** - SHAP values are consistent and provide an accurate measure of feature importance. 
- **Model agnostic** - It works with any ML model, giving it wide applicability. 

# Disadvantages
- **Computational complexity** - Calculating SHAP values can be computationally expensive, especially for complex models with lots of features. 
- **Interpretation challenges** - SHAP values can be challenging to interpret. Understanding the contribution of each feature to a model's prediction requires a good grasp of the model and the data.
