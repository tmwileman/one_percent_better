# Analogy
Imagine you have two kids of building blocks. Big, colorgul Duplo blocks and tiny, detailed Lego pieces. 

High-level coding is like building with Duplo blocks. The pieces are big and easy to handle. You don't have to worry too much about the tiny details; you can quickly put together something fun and functional like a house or car. High-level coding languages like this are easier to understand and use. They handle a lot of the complicated stuff for you so you can create cool things on the computer without worrying too much about the small details. 

Low-level coding is like using those tiny, detailed Lego pieces. With these you can build really intricate and specific things like a spaceship with lots of little parts. But building with Lego is harder and takes more time and attention to detail. Low-level coding languages are similar. They are more complex and give you more control over small details of how the computer works but they are harder to learn and use.

In sum, high-level coding is easier and more about quickly building cool stuff while low-level coding is more about having detailed control but requires more effort and knowledge.

# High-level coding languages

- **Abstracted and user-friendly** - High-level languages are more abstract. This means they are closer to human language and further from machine language (the language that computers understand directly). Languages like Python, JavaScript, and Java fall into this category. They are designed to be easy to read and write, making them more user-friendly.
- **Less control over hardware** - Languages like Python and JavaScript manage a lot of the complex details for you, like memory management. This makes them easier to use but gives you less control over how your program interacts witht he computer's hardware.
- **Portability** - High-level code is generally more portable, meaning you can run it on different types of computers without many changes, This is because it's often interpreted or compliled into machine language by another program, rather than being written directly for a specific type of hardware.
- **Common uses** - These languages are widely used for developing web applications, mobile apps, desktop software, and data analysis and machine learning.

# Low-level coding languages
- **Closer to machine language** - Low-level languages are closer to the computer's native language (binary code). Assembly language and machine code are examples of low-level languages. They are much harder to read and write because they are so much closer to the actual binary code that computers understand.
- **More control over hardware** - These languages give youa. lot of control over the computer's hardware. This means you can optimize your program to run efficiently and do things that high-level languages can't do.
- **Less portability** - Lov-level code is often specific to a particular type of computer or processor. This means a program written for one type of computer might not work on another without significant changes.
- **Common uses** - These languages are used for tasks that require direct interaction with the hardware like writing operating systems, device drivers, or other systems-level programming.
