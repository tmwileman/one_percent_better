# ABI Testing

## What is ABI
Think of a video game console and its games. The console (think PlayStation or Xbox) has a specific way it read and plays games. Now, imagine if you tried to play a PlayStation game on Xbox. It wouldn't work because each console has it's own unique way of communicating with the games made for it. 

Similarly, in order for a program to run on an operating system (OS), it must be able to requisition computational assets like data structures and routines. Application Binary Interface (ABI) is a set of rules that defines how these assets are accessed in machine code. Each OS requisitions these assets in a different way. Importantly, if a program adheres to an ABI, it will be able to run without modification on any other operating system that employs the same ABI. 

Applications are typically written in high-level languages like Python or Java. A complier then transforms this code into binary format which is what the computer's processor understands. For this program to run correctly, it needs to interact with the OS's libraries and other programs. This is where ABI come in. ABI includes details like:

- **Data Types and Sizes:** How integers, characters, and other data types are represented in binary form.
- **Function Calling Conventions:** How functions receive parameters and return results.
- **Register Use:** How the program's instructions can use the computer's registers.
- **Memory Layout:** How memory is organized and accessed.

## What is ABI Testing
ABI testing is the process used to verigy that a softward component conforms to the defined ABI rules. It's all about ensuring the compiled code is converted into a format that can correctly communitate with the OS and other programs. There are five key components to ABI testing:

- **Compatibility Checks:** Is the compiled binary compatible with the OS. 
- **Functionality Testing:** Do the program's functions and routines behave as expected. 
- **Checking Binary Interfaces:** Do function calls, data types and data structures match ABI specifications so they can properly interact with other binaries.
- **Regression Testing:** Do changes to the code break the binary's compatability with the OS or other components.
- **Cross-Platform Testing:** Is a program able to run on all of the platforms it needs to.

## Why Is It Important
ABI testing prevents issues like crashes or malfunctioning applications. For example, OS updates can lead to ABI incompatibilities with existing applications or drivers or libraries that are updated without maintaining ABI compatibility can break. Another consideration is hardware. Transitioning from 32-bit to 64-bit architecture could result in incompatibilities that break software functionality.

## Can We Test ABI Compatibility?
Short answer is yes.

- **Automated Testing Tools:** '[ABI Compliance Checker](https://lvc.github.io/abi-compliance-checker/)' and '[ABI Laboratory](https://abi-laboratory.pro/)' can automatically compare different versions of binary files to identify incompatibilities. 
- **Integration Testing:** Testing your application with the libraries and systems it interacts with can help catch issues.
- **Regression Testing:** Most repos build tests that ensure functionality. Running these tests when updating code can also catch compatibility issues.
- **Versioning:** Proper versioning can manage ABI compatibility, making it easier to track and test changes.
