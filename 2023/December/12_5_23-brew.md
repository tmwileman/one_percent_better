# Brew
#Tags: #BREW #Linux #Compile 

# What is it?
Brew is a build system that builds software packages in large complex environments like RHEL and Fedora. It automates the process of compiling source code into binary Red Hat Package Manager (RPM packages). Once compiled, these packages can then be tested and distributed. 

# Integration with Dist-Git
Dist-Git is a system used to manage the source code, packaging, and distribution of Linux distributions. It is a crucial part of the Fedora and RHEL development workflow because it helps maintain control over the thousands of packages in these distributions.

Brew is designed to work well with Dist-Git due in large part to its ability to build a new version of a distribution using a spec file. A spec file contains all the necessary instructions to build a package, including dependencies, compile options, and installation scrips. 

# Similarity to Koji
Koji is another build system used in the Fedora project. While Brew is similar to Koji, Brew is tailored for Red Hat internal use. Koji is the open source alternative. 

# Automation and Efficiency
Brew facilitates a lot of automation. It can resolve dependencies, downoad source code, compile for various architectures, and ensure the build environment is clear and consistent. 

# Summary
Brew Build System is a specialized, enterprise-grade tool for building RPM packages. It automates much of the process required compile, assemble, and test software.
