# Analogy
A tarball is like a filing cabinent. Your filing cabinent, if you have one, is full of various kinds of files. Bills, medical records, certificates, etc. The filing cabinent is a convienent place to store all of these files. Tarballs are similar but instead of personal records, tarballs contain various types of computer files. Typically files required to load and run an application. 

Now imagine your filing cabinent can shrink or expand to the size of the files in it. In a sense the filing cabinent removes all of the extra air so it contains only what is required and takes up less space. Tarballs are similar in that they compress their contents so they save space (remove redundancies and patterns). This is typically done using gzip. Thus tarballs typically end with .gz.

# Basics
<b>tarball</b> is a term used in computing to describe a file that has been archived using the "tar" command. Tar stands for "tape archive". This command combines multiple files into a single file making it easier to handle and transport as a single package. This is really useful for software distribution or backup pruposes. 

Tarballs are often compressed to save space and make transfer faster.
